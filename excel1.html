    <h1>Week 1: Introduction to Microsoft Excel</h1>
    <h2>Topic 1: Introduction to Microsoft Excel</h2>
    <p>Microsoft Excel is a powerful spreadsheet application used for various purposes such as data analysis, calculations, and data visualization. It consists of a grid of cells organized into rows and columns. Excel allows users to perform calculations, create charts, and manage data efficiently.</p>
    <h2>Topic 2: Exploring the Excel Interface</h2>
    <p>The Excel interface consists of various elements, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ribbon:</strong> The Ribbon is a tabbed toolbar at the top of the Excel window, containing commands organized into tabs like Home, Insert, Page Layout, Formulas, Data, Review, and View.</li>
        <li><strong>Worksheets:</strong> Excel workbooks contain one or more worksheets (also known as spreadsheets). By default, a new workbook starts with three worksheets, but you can add or delete them as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Cells:</strong> Cells are the individual rectangular boxes where you can enter data, perform calculations, and display results.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Topic 3: Workbook, Worksheets, and Cells</h2>
    <p>In Excel, you work with workbooks, worksheets, and cells. Let's see some code examples for these concepts:</p>
    <pre><code>' Create a new Excel application
Dim xlApp As New Excel.Application
' Create a new workbook
Dim xlWorkbook As Excel.Workbook
xlWorkbook = xlApp.Workbooks.Add()
' Add a new worksheet to the workbook
Dim xlWorksheet As Excel.Worksheet
xlWorksheet = xlWorkbook.Sheets.Add()
' Access and populate data in cells
xlWorksheet.Cells(1, 1).Value = "Hello, Excel!"
xlWorksheet.Cells(2, 1).Value = 42
' Save the workbook to a file
xlWorkbook.SaveAs("C:\Path\to\YourWorkbook.xlsx")
' Close Excel and release resources
xlWorkbook.Close()
xlApp.Quit()
Marshal.ReleaseComObject(xlWorksheet)
Marshal.ReleaseComObject(xlWorkbook)
Marshal.ReleaseComObject(xlApp)
</code></pre>
    <h2>Topic 4: Entering and Editing Data</h2>
    <p>You can enter and edit data in Excel cells easily. Here's a code example to demonstrate data entry:</p>
    <pre><code>' Access a cell and set its value
xlWorksheet.Cells(1, 2).Value = "Excel is awesome!"
' Edit existing data
xlWorksheet.Cells(2, 1).Value = xlWorksheet.Cells(2, 1).Value + 10
</code></pre>
    <h2>Topic 5: Saving and Opening Workbooks</h2>
    <p>To save and open workbooks in Excel, you can use these code examples:</p>
    <pre><code>' Save the workbook with a different name and format
xlWorkbook.SaveAs("C:\Path\to\NewWorkbook.xlsx", FileFormat:=Excel.XlFileFormat.xlOpenXMLWorkbook)
' Close the workbook
xlWorkbook.Close()
' Open an existing workbook
Dim openedWorkbook As Excel.Workbook
openedWorkbook = xlApp.Workbooks.Open("C:\Path\to\ExistingWorkbook.xlsx")
' Close Excel and release resources
openedWorkbook.Close()
xlApp.Quit()
Marshal.ReleaseComObject(openedWorkbook)
Marshal.ReleaseComObject(xlApp)
</code></pre>
    <p>These code examples demonstrate some of the basic tasks you can perform in Excel, from creating workbooks and worksheets to entering, editing, and saving data. Excel VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) is a powerful tool to automate various Excel tasks and processes.</p>
