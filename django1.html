    <h1>Introduction to Web Development and Django</h1>
    <p>Web development is the process of creating web applications or websites that can be accessed over the internet. It involves various technologies, languages, and frameworks to build dynamic and interactive web experiences. Django is a high-level Python web framework that simplifies the process of web development by providing a set of tools, libraries, and conventions to help developers build robust and scalable web applications.</p>
    <h2>Setting up a Development Environment</h2>
    <p>Before diving into Django development, you need to set up a development environment. This typically involves the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Installing Python:</strong> Django is a Python framework, so you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website <a href="https://www.python.org/">here</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Installing Django:</strong> Once Python is installed, you can use the Python package manager, pip, to install Django. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code>pip install Django</code></pre>
    <p>3. <strong>Text Editor or IDE:</strong> Choose a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for coding. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and Sublime Text.</p>
    <h2>Creating a Django Project and Application</h2>
    <p>In Django, a project is a collection of settings, configurations, and applications that work together to create a web application. An application, on the other hand, is a self-contained module that performs a specific functionality within the project. Here's how you can create a Django project and application:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Create a Django Project:</strong> Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Django project:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code>django-admin startproject projectname</code></pre>
    <p>Replace <code>projectname</code> with the name of your project.</p>
    <ol start="2">
        <li><strong>Create a Django Application:</strong> To create a new Django application, navigate to your project's directory and run:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code>python manage.py startapp appname</code></pre>
    <p>Replace <code>appname</code> with the name of your application.</p>
    <h2>Understanding the MVC Architecture (Model-View-Controller)</h2>
    <p>Django follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which is sometimes referred to as Model-View-Template (MVT) in Django's context. Here's a breakdown of how MVC/MVT works in Django:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Model:</strong> The Model represents the data and the business logic of your application. It defines the structure of your database tables and how data is stored and retrieved. Models are typically defined as Python classes. Here's an example of a simple model for a blog post:</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code>from django.db import models
class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')
</code></pre>
    <ul start="2">
        <li><strong>View:</strong> The View handles the presentation logic and controls the flow of data between the Model and the Template. Views are Python functions that take a web request and return a web response. Here's an example of a view function:</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code>from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Post
def index(request):
    posts = Post.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'index.html', {'posts': posts})
</code></pre>
    <ul start="3">
        <li><strong>Template:</strong> The Template is responsible for rendering the HTML and presentation of the data. It defines how the data from the View should be displayed to the user. Templates are typically HTML files with placeholders for dynamic data. Here's an example of a template:</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Blog&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Blog&lt;/h1&gt;
    {% for post in posts %}
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;{{ post.content }}&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Published on: {{ post.pub_date }}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    {% endfor %}
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>In this example, the Model defines the structure of a blog post, the View retrieves the posts from the database, and the Template renders the posts in an HTML format.</p>
    <p>This is just a basic introduction to getting started with Django. As you progress, you'll learn more about Django's powerful features and how to build dynamic web applications.</p>
