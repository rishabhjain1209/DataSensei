    <h1>Vectors, Matrices, and Arrays in R:</h1>
    <h2>Vectors:</h2>
    <p>In R, a vector is a one-dimensional array that can hold elements of the same data type, such as numbers or characters.</p>
    <pre><code>
# Creating Vectors Example
# Numeric vector
numeric_vector &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# Character vector
character_vector &lt;- c("apple", "banana", "cherry")
# Logical vector
logical_vector &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
# Accessing Elements
print(numeric_vector[3])   # Access the 3rd element of the numeric vector
print(character_vector[2]) # Access the 2nd element of the character vector
print(logical_vector[1])   # Access the 1st element of the logical vector
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Matrices:</h2>
    <p>A matrix in R is a two-dimensional data structure that contains elements arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are useful for storing and manipulating numerical data with a regular structure.</p>
    <pre><code>
# Creating Matrices Example
# Create a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns
matrix_data &lt;- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
# Accessing Elements
print(matrix_data[1, 2])  # Access the element in the 1st row and 2nd column
print(matrix_data[2, 3])  # Access the element in the 2nd row and 3rd column
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Arrays:</h2>
    <p>An array in R is a multi-dimensional data structure that can hold elements of the same data type. Arrays can have more than two dimensions.</p>
    <pre><code>
# Creating Arrays Example
# Create a 3D array with dimensions 2x3x2
array_data &lt;- array(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), dim = c(2, 3, 2))
# Accessing Elements
print(array_data[1, 2, 1])  # Access the element at (1, 2, 1)
print(array_data[2, 3, 2])  # Access the element at (2, 3, 2)
    </code></pre>
    <p>Vectors, matrices, and arrays are essential data structures in R that allow you to work with and manipulate data effectively. They are the building blocks for more complex data analysis and modeling tasks.</p>
<br><br>
    <h1>Lists, Data Frames, and Factors in R:</h1>
    <h2>Lists:</h2>
    <p>A list in R is a versatile data structure that can hold elements of different data types, making it suitable for storing complex, heterogeneous data.</p>
    <pre><code>
# Creating Lists Example
# Create a list with different data types
my_list &lt;- list(
  name = "John",
  age = 30,
  hobbies = c("reading", "hiking"),
  is_student = TRUE
)
# Accessing Elements
print(my_list$name)       # Access the "name" element
print(my_list$hobbies[2]) # Access the second hobby
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Data Frames:</h2>
    <p>A data frame in R is a two-dimensional data structure used to store tabular data with columns of different data types.</p>
    <pre><code>
# Creating Data Frames Example
# Create a data frame with name, age, and city columns
data_frame &lt;- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
  age = c(25, 30, 22),
  city = c("New York", "San Francisco", "Los Angeles")
)
# Accessing Elements
print(data_frame$name)            # Access the "name" column
print(data_frame$age[2])         # Access the age of the second person
print(data_frame[2, "city"])     # Access the city of the second person
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Factors:</h2>
    <p>Factors in R are used to represent categorical or nominal data, making them suitable for modeling and analysis.</p>
    <pre><code>
# Creating Factors Example
# Create a factor vector representing educational levels
education_levels &lt;- c("High School", "Bachelor's", "Master's", "Ph.D.")
factor_education &lt;- factor(education_levels, levels = c("High School", "Bachelor's", "Master's", "Ph.D."))
# Summarizing Factor
summary(factor_education)
    </code></pre>
    <p>Lists, data frames, and factors are essential data structures in R, each serving a specific purpose in data analysis and manipulation. Understanding when and how to use them is crucial for effective data handling and analysis in R.</p>
