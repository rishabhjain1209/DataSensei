<h1>Lesson 4.1: Forking Repositories</h1>
<p>Forking a repository on GitHub allows you to create a personal copy of someone else's repository. This is useful when you want to contribute to an open-source project:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to the repository you want to fork on GitHub.</li>
    <li>Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Lesson 4.2: Creating Pull Requests</h1>
<p>Pull requests (PRs) are a way to propose changes to a repository. After forking and making changes to your forked repository:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to your forked repository on GitHub.</li>
    <li>Click the "New Pull Request" button.</li>
    <li>Choose the base repository and branch where you want to merge your changes.</li>
    <li>Review your changes and click "Create Pull Request."</li>
</ol>
<h1>Lesson 4.3: Reviewing and Approving Pull Requests</h1>
<p>Collaborators or maintainers of a repository can review and approve pull requests:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Review the changes in the pull request.</li>
    <li>Add comments or suggestions.</li>
    <li>If the changes are satisfactory, click "Approve" and "Merge" to merge the pull request.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Lesson 4.4: Resolving Pull Request Comments</h1>
<p>When someone reviews your pull request and provides comments, you can address them by making further commits:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Make changes in your local repository to address the comments.</li>
    <li>Commit those changes.</li>
    <li>Push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub.</li>
    <li>The pull request will automatically update with your new commits.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Lesson 4.5: Collaborative Workflow on GitHub</h1>
<p>Collaborative workflows involve multiple contributors working on the same repository:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Clone the repository you want to contribute to:</li>
   <pre><code>git clone <repository_url></code></pre>
    <li>Create a new branch for your changes:</li>
   <pre><code>git checkout -b my-feature-branch</code></pre>
    <li>Make changes, commit them, and push to your forked repository.</li>
    <li>Create a pull request from your branch to the original repository.</li>
    <li>Collaborate with others through comments and reviews.</li>
    <li>Once your pull request is approved, it can be merged into the main project.</li>
</ol>
<p>These lessons cover essential aspects of collaborating on GitHub, from forking repositories to creating and reviewing pull requests. Collaborative workflows are vital for open-source projects and team-based development.</p>
