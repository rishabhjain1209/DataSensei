    <h1>Module 1: Introduction to Pandas</h1>
    <h2>1.1 What is Pandas?</h2>
    <p>Pandas is an open-source Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides easy-to-use data structures (Series and DataFrame) and functions for working with structured data. Pandas is widely used in data science, machine learning, and data analysis tasks due to its flexibility and efficiency.</p>
    <h2>1.2 Why Use Pandas for Data Analysis?</h2>
    <p>Pandas simplifies data manipulation by providing data structures (Series and DataFrame) that can handle various data types and formats, making it easier to work with real-world data. It offers powerful data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation capabilities, allowing users to preprocess data efficiently. Pandas seamlessly integrates with other libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib, making it a valuable tool for data scientists and analysts.</p>
    <h3>Code Example:</h3>
    <pre><code>import pandas as pd
# Creating a simple Pandas Series
data = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(data)
</code></pre>
    <h2>1.3 Installing Pandas</h2>
    <p>Pandas can be installed using Python's package manager, pip. It's recommended to install Pandas as part of a broader data science environment using a tool like Anaconda. To install Pandas using pip, you can run the following command:</p>
    <pre><code>pip install pandas</code></pre>
    <h2>1.4 Importing Pandas and Basic Data Structures (Series and DataFrame)</h2>
    <p>Importing Pandas is the first step to start using it. You can import it with the common alias 'pd'. Pandas provides two main data structures: Series (1D labeled array) and DataFrame (2D labeled data structure).</p>
    <h3>Code Example:</h3>
    <pre><code>import pandas as pd
# Creating a Pandas Series
data = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
# Creating a Pandas DataFrame from a dictionary
data_dict = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
             'Age': [25, 30, 35]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data_dict)
print(data)
print(df)
</code></pre>
    <p>These examples provide a comprehensive introduction to Pandas, its advantages in data analysis, installation steps, and the basic data structures (Series and DataFrame) along with code samples for each topic. Students can start using Pandas for data manipulation right from the beginning of the course.</p>
