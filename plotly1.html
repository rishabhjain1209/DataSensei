    <h2>1. What is Data Visualization?</h2>
    <p>Data visualization is the graphical representation of data to help people understand and interpret complex
        information. It involves using charts, graphs, and other visual elements to convey patterns, trends, and insights
        hidden within datasets. Data visualization is a crucial tool for data analysis, as it allows users to see data in
        a way that makes it easier to comprehend and draw meaningful conclusions.</p>
    <h2>2. Introduction to Plotly</h2>
    <p>Plotly is a powerful open-source library for creating interactive data visualizations in Python. It supports a wide
        range of chart types, from basic line and scatter plots to 3D surface plots and geographic maps. Plotly's
        interactive capabilities make it an excellent choice for creating dashboards and web-based data visualizations
        that allow users to explore data dynamically.</p>
    <h2>3. Setting up your development environment</h2>
    <p>Before you can start using Plotly, you need to set up your development environment. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Install Python</h3>
    <p>If you haven't already, download and install Python from the <a
            href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">official Python website</a>. Make sure to add Python to your
        system's PATH during installation.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Install Plotly</h3>
    <p>You can install Plotly using pip, the Python package manager. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the
        following command:</p>
    <code>pip install plotly</code>
    <h3>Step 3: Install Jupyter Notebook (Optional)</h3>
    <p>Jupyter Notebook is an excellent tool for interactive data analysis and visualization. You can install it using
        pip as well:</p>
    <code>pip install jupyter</code>
    <h3>Step 4: Create a Jupyter Notebook (Optional)</h3>
    <p>If you installed Jupyter Notebook, you can create a new notebook by running:</p>
    <code>jupyter notebook</code>
    <p>This will open a web-based interface where you can create and run Python code cells.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Import Plotly</h3>
    <p>In your Jupyter Notebook or Python script, import Plotly as follows:</p>
    <code>import plotly.graph_objects as go</code>
    <p>Now you're ready to start creating interactive visualizations with Plotly.</p>
    <h2>4. Code Example</h2>
    <p>Here's a simple example of creating a scatter plot using Plotly:</p>
    <pre><code>import plotly.graph_objects as go
# Sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
# Create a scatter plot
fig = go.Figure(data=go.Scatter(x=x, y=y, mode='markers'))
# Customize the plot
fig.update_layout(
    title='Simple Scatter Plot',
    xaxis=dict(title='X-axis Label'),
    yaxis=dict(title='Y-axis Label')
)
# Show the plot
fig.show()
</code></pre>
    <p>This code imports Plotly, creates a scatter plot with sample data, and customizes the plot's title and axis labels.
        Finally, it displays the plot using the <code>fig.show()</code> method. You can run this code in a Jupyter
        Notebook or a Python script to visualize your data.</p>
    <p>This sets the stage for your introduction to data visualization and Plotly. In the coming weeks, you'll delve deeper
        into different types of visualizations and advanced Plotly features.</p>
