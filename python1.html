        <p>Here's a simple Python code example that prints "Hello, World!" to the console, illustrating Python's readability and simplicity:</p>
        <pre><code># This is a Python comment
        print("Hello, World!")
        </code></pre>
        <p>To execute this code, you can save it to a <code>.py</code> file (e.g., <code>hello.py</code>) and run it using the Python interpreter:</p>
        <pre><code>python hello.py
        </code></pre>
        <p>This will display "Hello, World!" on your console, showcasing how Python's straightforward syntax allows you to achieve tasks with minimal code.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Python Installation and Quickstart</h2>
        <h3>Python Installation</h3>
        <p>Python is a versatile programming language that may already be installed on your computer. To check if you have Python installed, follow these steps:</p>
        <h4>On Windows:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the Command Line (cmd.exe).</li>
            <li>Run the following command:</li>
        </ol>
        <pre><code>C:\Users\Your Name&gt;python --version
        </code></pre>
        <h4>On Linux or Mac:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the Terminal.</li>
            <li>Run the following command:</li>
        </ol>
        <pre><code>python --version
        </code></pre>
        <p>If Python is installed, you will see its version number displayed. If it's not installed, you can download and install Python for free from the official website: <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>.</p>
        <h3>Python Quickstart</h3>
        <p>Python is an interpreted programming language, which means you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then execute them using the Python interpreter. Here's how to run a Python file from the command line:</p>
        <pre><code>C:\Users\Your Name&gt;python helloworld.py
        </code></pre>
        <p>In the above command, replace "helloworld.py" with the name of your Python file. Let's create a simple Python file called <code>helloworld.py</code> in any text editor:</p>
        <h4>helloworld.py</h4>
        <pre><code>```python
        print("Hello, World!")
        ```
        </code></pre>
        <p>Save your file. Open the command line and navigate to the directory where you saved your file. Then, run the following command:</p>
        <pre><code>C:\Users\Your Name&gt;python helloworld.py
        </code></pre>
        <p>The output should be:</p>
        <pre><code>Hello, World!
        </code></pre>
        <p>Congratulations, you have successfully written and executed your first Python program.</p>
        <h3>Python Command Line</h3>
        <p>You can test short snippets of Python code directly in the Python command line interface without writing code in a file. Here's how to access the Python command line on Windows, Mac, or Linux:</p>
        <h4>On Windows:</h4>
        <p>Open the Command Line (cmd.exe) and run:</p>
        <pre><code>C:\Users\Your Name&gt;python
        </code></pre>
        <p>Or, if "python" doesn't work, you can try "py":</p>
        <pre><code>C:\Users\Your Name&gt;py
        </code></pre>
        <p>From there, you can write and execute Python code, including the "Hello, World!" example from earlier in the tutorial:</p>
        <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print("Hello, World!")
        </code></pre>
        <p>This will display "Hello, World!" in the command line.</p>
        <p>To exit the Python command line interface, simply type the following:</p>
        <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; exit()
        </code></pre>
        <p>This will return you to the regular command prompt. The Python command line is useful for testing code snippets and exploring Python interactively.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Python Syntax, Indentation, and Variables</h2>
        <h3>Execute Python Syntax</h3>
        <p>As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed in two primary ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Interactive Mode (Command Line)</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>You can write Python code directly in the Command Line or Python interpreter prompt (<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>) and execute it immediately.</li>
                </ul>
                <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print("Hello, World!")
        </code></pre>
                <p>This will output: <code>Hello, World!</code></p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Script Mode (Python Files)</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a Python script file with the <code>.py</code> file extension (e.g., <code>myfile.py</code>).</li>
                    <li>Run the script in the Command Line using the <code>python</code> command:</li>
                </ul>
                <pre><code>C:\Users\Your Name&gt;python myfile.py
        </code></pre>
                <p>This will execute the Python code saved in <code>myfile.py</code>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Python Indentation</h3>
        <p>Indentation in Python refers to the spaces or tabs at the beginning of a code line. Unlike many other programming languages where indentation is for readability only, in Python, it is crucial for defining the structure of your code.</p>
        <p>Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. For example:</p>
        <pre><code>if 5 &gt; 2:
            print("Five is greater than two!")
        </code></pre>
        <p>In the above code, the indentation with four spaces before <code>print</code> signifies that it is part of the <code>if</code> block. If you skip the indentation, Python will raise an error:</p>
        <pre><code># Syntax Error
        if 5 &gt; 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!")
        </code></pre>
        <p>The number of spaces for indentation is flexible, but it must be consistent within the same block of code. Common practice is to use four spaces for each level of indentation:</p>
        <pre><code>if 5 &gt; 2:
            print("Five is greater than two!")
            if 4 &lt; 3:
                print("This is another block of code.")
        </code></pre>
        <p>However, you can use tabs or a different number of spaces as long as you are consistent:</p>
        <pre><code>if 5 &gt; 2:
          print("Five is greater than two!")  # Using two spaces for indentation
        if 5 &gt; 2:
                print("Five is greater than two!")  # Using eight spaces for indentation
        </code></pre>
        <p>But mixing indentation styles within the same block of code will result in an error:</p>
        <pre><code># Syntax Error
        if 5 &gt; 2:
          print("Five is greater than two!")
                print("This will cause an error!")
        </code></pre>
        <h3>Python Variables</h3>
        <p>In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to them. Unlike some programming languages that require variable declaration, Python dynamically creates variables as you assign values:</p>
        <pre><code>x = 5
        y = "Hello, World!"
        </code></pre>
        <p>In the above example, <code>x</code> is assigned the integer value <code>5</code>, and <code>y</code> is assigned the string value <code>"Hello, World!"</code>. Python allows you to assign values of different types to variables without explicit type declarations.</p>
        <p>You will learn more about variables in the Python Variables chapter, including variable naming conventions and data types.</p>
