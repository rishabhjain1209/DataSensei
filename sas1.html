    <h2>Module 1: Introduction to SAS</h2>
    <h3>What is SAS?</h3>
    <p>SAS (Statistical Analysis System) is a software suite developed by SAS Institute Inc. that provides a wide range of tools for data analysis, statistical modeling, data management, and reporting. It is widely used in various industries, including finance, healthcare, marketing, and government, for making data-driven decisions, conducting research, and solving complex business problems.</p>
    <p>Key features of SAS include its extensive library of statistical and analytical procedures, data manipulation capabilities, data visualization tools, and a powerful programming language. SAS is known for its reliability, scalability, and flexibility, making it suitable for both small-scale data analysis and large-scale enterprise applications.</p>
    <h3>Overview of SAS Components and Capabilities:</h3>
    <p>SAS consists of various components and modules designed to handle different aspects of data analysis and management. Some key components and capabilities of SAS include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Base SAS:</strong> This is the core component of SAS and includes essential data management and statistical procedures. Base SAS provides tools for data input and output, data cleaning, basic statistical analysis, and report generation.</li>
        <li><strong>SAS/STAT:</strong> SAS/STAT is an add-on module that offers a comprehensive library of statistical procedures for a wide range of analyses, including regression analysis, hypothesis testing, survival analysis, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>SAS/GRAPH:</strong> SAS/GRAPH is used for creating various types of graphs and charts to visualize data. It allows users to generate plots, bar charts, pie charts, and maps.</li>
        <li><strong>SAS/SQL:</strong> This module provides SQL (Structured Query Language) capabilities within SAS, enabling users to query, join, and manipulate data using SQL syntax.</li>
        <li><strong>SAS/ETS:</strong> SAS/ETS (Econometrics and Time Series) is used for advanced time series analysis, forecasting, and econometric modeling.</li>
        <li><strong>SAS/IML:</strong> SAS/IML (Interactive Matrix Language) is a matrix-oriented programming language within SAS that allows users to perform advanced matrix operations and custom statistical analyses.</li>
        <li><strong>SAS Enterprise Miner:</strong> Enterprise Miner is a data mining and machine learning tool that helps users build predictive models, perform cluster analysis, and automate data preprocessing.</li>
        <li><strong>SAS Enterprise Guide:</strong> Enterprise Guide is a user-friendly graphical interface for SAS, making it easier for users to perform data analysis, create reports, and generate code without extensive programming knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>SAS Visual Analytics:</strong> This component provides interactive data visualization and exploration tools for creating dashboards, reports, and interactive web applications.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>SAS Interface and Environment Setup:</h3>
    <p>SAS can be accessed and used through various interfaces, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SAS Display Manager:</strong> This is a traditional interface that provides a menu-driven environment for interacting with SAS. It is commonly used for interactive data analysis and report generation.</li>
        <li><strong>SAS Studio:</strong> SAS Studio is a web-based interface that offers a modern and user-friendly environment for working with SAS. It includes a code editor, point-and-click features, and integration with the SAS environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Command-Line Interface:</strong> Experienced users can interact with SAS using command-line interfaces, where they can write SAS programs and execute them directly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To set up the SAS environment, you typically need to install SAS software on your computer or access it through a server-based installation. You may also need to configure your data sources, libraries, and preferences based on your specific requirements.</p>
    <p>In summary, SAS is a powerful software suite for data analysis and statistical modeling with a wide range of components and capabilities. Users can choose from various interfaces and set up their SAS environment to suit their needs, whether for data exploration, statistical analysis, machine learning, or reporting.</p>
