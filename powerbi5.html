    <h2>5.1 Publishing to Power BI Service</h2>
    <h3>Uploading Reports and Datasets</h3>
    <p>After creating your reports in Power BI Desktop, the next step is publishing them to the Power BI Service. Here's how to do it:</p>
    <ol>

            <ul>
                <li>In Power BI Desktop, click "Publish" and select a workspace in the Power BI Service.</li>
                <li>The report is uploaded to the cloud, making it accessible online.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Publishing a Dataset:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>You can publish datasets (data models) independently of reports, making them available for multiple reports.</li>
                <li>Go to the Power BI Service, select a workspace, and choose "Get Data" to connect to a published dataset.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Sharing and Collaboration</h3>
    <p>Sharing reports with others and collaborating in real-time are essential aspects of using the Power BI Service.</p>
