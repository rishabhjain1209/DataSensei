    <h1>Introduction to R:</h1>
    <p>R is a powerful programming language and environment for statistical computing and data analysis. It provides a wide range of tools and libraries for tasks related to data manipulation, statistical analysis, visualization, and more. In this section, we'll start by covering the installation of R and setting up RStudio, which is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for working with R.</p>
    <h2>Installing R:</h2>
    <p>To get started with R, you first need to install it on your computer. You can download R from the official website, <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</a>, and follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).</p>
    <p>Once you have R installed, you can open it in your terminal or console by simply typing <code>R</code> and pressing Enter. This will give you access to the R command-line interface (CLI), where you can run R code interactively.</p>
    <h2>Installing RStudio:</h2>
    <p>While the R CLI is sufficient for many tasks, using an IDE like RStudio can greatly enhance your productivity and make it easier to work with R projects. RStudio provides a user-friendly interface with features like code editing, interactive plotting, package management, and more.</p>
    <p>To install RStudio, go to the RStudio website at <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">https://www.rstudio.com/</a>, and download the RStudio Desktop version for your operating system. Once downloaded, follow the installation instructions.</p>
    <h2>Using RStudio:</h2>
    <p>After successfully installing RStudio, you can open it and you'll be greeted with a window that typically consists of four panels:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Script Editor:</strong> This is where you can write and edit your R code files. You can create a new script by clicking "File" > "New File" > "R Script."</li>
        <li><strong>Console:</strong> The R console is where you can interactively run R code. You can type commands directly here and see the results immediately. You can also send lines or sections of code from the script editor to the console for execution.</li>
        <li><strong>Environment & History:</strong> This panel displays information about the current R environment, including variables, data frames, and packages. It also keeps a history of commands you've executed.</li>
        <li><strong>Plots & Help:</strong> Here, you can view plots and charts generated by R. You can also access help documentation and search for information about R functions and packages.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Code Example:</h2>
    <p>Let's write a simple R code example in RStudio to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open RStudio.</li>
        <li>In the script editor, type the following code:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code># Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10
result <- sum(1:10)
# Print the result
print(result)
</code></pre>
    <ol start="3">
        <li>Select the code you want to run (in this case, everything), and click the "Run" button in the script editor toolbar.</li>
        <li>You'll see the result displayed in the console panel.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is just a basic example to get you started. As you continue learning R, you'll explore more complex data analysis, visualization, and statistical tasks using R and RStudio.</p>
