</head>
<body>
    <h1>Lesson 1: What is Deep Learning?</h1>
    <p>In Lesson 1, we will introduce the concept of deep learning and its significance in the field of machine learning. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on using neural networks to model complex patterns and representations in data. Here, we'll cover the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Definition of deep learning.</li>
        <li>Historical context and evolution.</li>
        <li>Real-world applications and use cases.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Code Example:</h2>
    <pre><code>
# Importing libraries
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
# Create a simple neural network model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
</code></pre>
    <h1>Lesson 2: Introduction to Keras and its ecosystem.</h1>
    <p>In Lesson 2, we'll delve into Keras, a popular deep learning framework that simplifies building and training neural networks. We'll cover:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is Keras and its role in deep learning.</li>
        <li>Keras architecture and its modular approach.</li>
        <li>The importance of Keras in rapid prototyping of deep learning models.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Code Example:</h2>
    <pre><code>
# Import Keras
import tensorflow.keras as keras
# Define a simple sequential model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
</code></pre>
    <h1>Lesson 3: Installing and setting up Keras.</h1>
    <p>In Lesson 3, we will guide you through the process of installing and setting up Keras on your machine. We'll cover:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Installation methods, such as using pip or conda.</li>
        <li>Verifying your Keras installation.</li>
        <li>Setting up the necessary backend (e.g., TensorFlow or Theano).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Code Example:</h2>
    <pre><code>
# Install Keras using pip
pip install tensorflow
# Verify Keras installation
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.keras.__version__)"
# Set up TensorFlow as the backend
# No code example needed as it's done through configuration files.
</code></pre>
    <p>By the end of Module 1, you'll have a solid understanding of deep learning, Keras, and how to set up your environment for further exploration of deep learning concepts and practical applications.</p>
