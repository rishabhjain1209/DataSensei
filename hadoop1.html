    <h2>Understanding Big Data and its Challenges</h2>
    <p>Big Data refers to extremely large and complex datasets that cannot be easily managed, processed, or analyzed using traditional data processing tools and techniques. It is characterized by the three Vs:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Big Data involves massive amounts of data that can range from terabytes to petabytes or more.</li>
        <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> Data is generated and collected at high speeds, often in real-time, from various sources such as sensors, social media, and online transactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety:</strong> Data comes in different formats, including structured (e.g., databases), semi-structured (e.g., XML, JSON), and unstructured (e.g., text, images).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Challenges of Big Data:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Storing large volumes of data efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Analyzing data quickly and accurately.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Scaling infrastructure to handle increasing data loads.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Integration:</strong> Combining data from diverse sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Ensuring data privacy and protection.</li>
        <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Managing and processing varied data formats.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Introduction to Hadoop and its Ecosystem</h2>
    <p>Hadoop is an open-source framework designed to handle Big Data. It offers a distributed storage and processing solution that can scale horizontally to accommodate massive datasets. The core components of Hadoop include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):</strong> A distributed file storage system that divides and replicates data across multiple nodes in a cluster.</li>
        <li><strong>MapReduce:</strong> A programming model and processing engine for distributed data processing. It allows developers to write code to process and analyze data in parallel across the cluster.</li>
        <li><strong>YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator):</strong> A resource management layer that helps manage and allocate resources (CPU, memory) for applications running on a Hadoop cluster.</li>
        <li><strong>Hadoop Common:</strong> A set of utilities and libraries shared by all Hadoop modules.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Hadoop's Role in Big Data Processing</h3>
    <p>Hadoop plays a significant role in addressing the challenges posed by Big Data by offering distributed storage and processing capabilities. It allows businesses to store, manage, and analyze large datasets efficiently and cost-effectively. Here's a simple code example in Java to demonstrate how to use Hadoop's MapReduce to count the occurrences of words in a text file:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            <!-- Insert your Java code here -->
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>This code demonstrates a simple Word Count program using Hadoop MapReduce, which is a common example for learning Hadoop. It reads text data, tokenizes it into words, counts the occurrences of each word, and produces the word count as output. This is just one of the many applications that Hadoop can handle in the Big Data processing ecosystem.</p>
