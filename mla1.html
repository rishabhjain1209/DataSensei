    <h1>Overview of Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. In machine learning, the computer learns patterns and relationships from the data, which allows it to perform tasks without being explicitly programmed for each specific task.</p>
    <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from a labeled dataset.</li>
                <li>It involves training the model on a dataset that contains input-output pairs.</li>
                <li>The model learns to map inputs to corresponding outputs and can make predictions on new, unseen data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example code using scikit-learn for a simple supervised learning task (linear regression):</p>
            <pre><code>... (insert code here)</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Unsupervised learning involves finding patterns or structures in data without explicit labels or supervision.</li>
                <li>It includes techniques like clustering and dimensionality reduction.</li>
                <li>Common algorithms include K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example code using scikit-learn for K-Means clustering:</p>
            <pre><code>... (insert code here)</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment.</li>
                <li>The agent takes actions to maximize a reward signal.</li>
                <li>It is commonly used in applications like game playing and robotics.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example code using OpenAI's Gym library for reinforcement learning:</p>
            <pre><code>... (insert code here)</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>The Machine Learning Pipeline</h2>
    <p>The machine learning pipeline consists of several stages, including data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment. Let's briefly discuss each stage:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Data preprocessing is the first step in the machine learning pipeline.</li>
                <li>It involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for training.</li>
                <li>Common preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example code using Pandas for data preprocessing:</p>
            <pre><code>... (insert code here)</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Model Selection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Model selection involves choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm or model for your specific task.</li>
                <li>It's important to consider factors like the nature of the problem (classification, regression, clustering), data size, and data complexity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example code for selecting a decision tree classifier:</p>
            <pre><code>... (insert code here)</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Model Training</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Model training is the process of using a labeled dataset to train the selected machine learning model.</li>
                <li>The model learns from the data and updates its internal parameters.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>(Code examples for model training were provided earlier in the supervised learning section.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Model Evaluation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Model evaluation involves assessing the model's performance on a separate test dataset.</li>
                <li>Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (for classification), and mean squared error (for regression).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example code for evaluating a classifier's performance:</p>
            <pre><code>... (insert code here)</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Deployment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Deployment is the final stage where you use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data in a real-world setting.</li>
                <li>This may involve integrating the model into a web application, mobile app, or any system where predictions are needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This overview provides a high-level understanding of machine learning and its components, including types of machine learning and the machine learning pipeline. In practice, machine learning projects can be much more complex, but these fundamental concepts and code examples serve as a starting point for your journey into machine learning.</p>
