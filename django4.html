    <h1>Creating Forms for User Input</h1>
    <p>In Django, forms are used to handle user input. Forms can be created manually, but Django provides a powerful form handling system that simplifies the process. Here's how you can create a simple form for a blog post using Django's form system:</p>
    <h3>forms.py:</h3>
    <pre><code>from django import forms
from .models import Post
class PostForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Post
        fields = ['title', 'content']
</code></pre>
    <p>In this example, we're creating a <code>PostForm</code> class that inherits from <code>forms.ModelForm</code>. This form is based on the <code>Post</code> model and includes fields for <code>title</code> and <code>content</code>.</p>
    <h2>Validating Form Data</h2>
    <p>Django's form system includes built-in data validation. You can specify rules for each form field, such as required fields or field types. Here's an example of adding validation rules to the <code>PostForm</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>class PostForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Post
        fields = ['title', 'content']
    def clean_title(self):
        title = self.cleaned_data['title']
        if len(title) < 5:
            raise forms.ValidationError("Title must be at least 5 characters long.")
        return title
</code></pre>
    <p>In this example, we're adding a custom validation rule to the <code>title</code> field. If the title is shorter than 5 characters, a validation error is raised.</p>
    <h2>Handling Form Submissions</h2>
    <p>To handle form submissions in Django, you need to create a view that processes the submitted data. Here's an example of a view that handles a form submission using the <code>PostForm</code>:</p>
    <h3>views.py:</h3>
    <pre><code>from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .models import Post
from .forms import PostForm
def create_post(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = PostForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('post_list')
    else:
        form = PostForm()
    return render(request, 'create_post.html', {'form': form})
</code></pre>
    <p>In this view, we check if the request method is <code>POST</code>. If it is, we create an instance of <code>PostForm</code> with the data from the request and check if it's valid using <code>form.is_valid()</code>. If the form is valid, we save the post and redirect to the post list. If the request method is not <code>POST</code>, we display an empty form.</p>
    <h2>Implementing User Registration and Authentication</h2>
    <p>Django provides a built-in authentication system that makes it easy to implement user registration and authentication. Here's an example of user registration using Django's built-in views:</p>
    <h3>urls.py:</h3>
    <pre><code>from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views
urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    path('register/', auth_views.RegisterView.as_view(), name='register'),
]
</code></pre>
    <p>With this URL configuration, users can access the registration form at <code>/register/</code>.</p>
    <p>Django also includes views and templates for login, logout, password reset, and more, making it straightforward to implement user authentication.</p>
    <p>By mastering the concepts in Module 4, you'll be well-prepared to create forms, validate user input, handle form submissions, and implement user registration and authentication in your Django application.</p>
