    <title>Week 4: Modifying Data</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Inserting, Updating, and Deleting Data</h2>
<p>In addition to querying data, you'll often need to modify the data in your MySQL database. This involves inserting new records, updating existing records, and deleting unwanted data.</p>
<h3>Inserting Data:</h3>
<pre>
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, department_id, salary)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 101, 60000);
</pre>
<h3>Updating Data:</h3>
<pre>
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 65000
WHERE employee_id = 101;
</pre>
<h3>Deleting Data:</h3>
<pre>
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 101;
</pre>
<h2>Transactions and ACID Properties</h2>
<p>Transactions are sequences of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. They ensure the consistency and integrity of your data by following the ACID properties:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Atomicity:</strong> All changes within a transaction are treated as a single unit. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.</li>
    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> A transaction brings the database from one consistent state to another. The database must satisfy all constraints after a successful transaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Transactions are isolated from each other until they are committed. This prevents concurrent transactions from interfering with each other.</li>
    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent, even in the event of system failures.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Example: Using transactions</h3>
<pre>
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 101;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 102;
COMMIT;
</pre>
<h2>Managing Indexes for Performance Optimization</h2>
<p>Indexes are data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations, especially for large tables. Common types of indexes include primary keys, unique indexes, and non-unique indexes.</p>
<h3>Example: Creating an index on a column</h3>
<pre>
CREATE INDEX idx_last_name ON employees (last_name);
</pre>
<h3>Example: Dropping an index</h3>
<pre>
DROP INDEX idx_last_name ON employees;
</pre>
<h2>Handling NULL Values and Default Values</h2>
<p>NULL is a special marker used in MySQL to indicate that a data value does not exist in the database. You can specify default values for columns to handle cases where no value is provided during insertion.</p>
<h3>Example: Defining a column with a default value</h3>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    birth_date DATE DEFAULT '2000-01-01'
);
</pre>
<h3>Example: Inserting a row with NULL and default values</h3>
<pre>
INSERT INTO students (student_id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe');
</pre>
<p>In this week, you've learned how to modify data in your MySQL database by inserting, updating, and deleting records. You've also explored transactions and the ACID properties, which ensure data consistency and integrity. Additionally, you've seen how to manage indexes for performance optimization and handle NULL values and default values in your database schema. These skills are essential for maintaining and optimizing your database.</p>
