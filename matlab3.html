<h1>Module 3: Working with Data</h1>
<h2>Importing and Exporting Data:</h2>
<p>MATLAB provides various functions and tools to import and export data from a variety of file formats, such as text files, spreadsheets, and more. Common functions for data import and export include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong><code>load</code> and <code>save</code>:</strong> You can use the <code>load</code> function to load data from MAT-files and the <code>save</code> function to save MATLAB variables to MAT-files.
    </li>   
    <li>
        <strong><code>readtable</code> and <code>writetable</code>:</strong> These functions are used to read and write data to and from spreadsheet files, such as CSV, Excel, and more, using MATLAB tables.
    </li>    
    <li>
        <strong><code>importdata</code>:</strong> This versatile function can read data from various file formats, such as text, CSV, and Excel files, and returns the data as a structured array.
    </li>    
    <li>
        <strong><code>xlsread</code> and <code>xlswrite</code>:</strong> These functions allow you to read and write data to Excel files directly.
    </li>    
    <li>
        <strong><code>fread</code> and <code>fwrite</code>:</strong> These functions are used for reading and writing binary data files.
    </li>    
    <li>
        <strong><code>textscan</code>:</strong> It is useful for reading data from text files with a specified format.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Data Manipulation and Preprocessing:</h2>
<p>MATLAB provides a wide range of functions and tools for data manipulation and preprocessing. Some commonly used functions include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Indexing and Slicing:</strong> You can access and modify specific elements or portions of arrays and matrices using indexing and slicing operations.
    </li>    
    <li>
        <strong>Filtering and Sorting:</strong> MATLAB provides functions for filtering data based on conditions and for sorting data in ascending or descending order.
    </li>    
    <li>
        <strong>Data Transformation:</strong> You can perform various data transformations, such as scaling, normalization, and smoothing, using built-in functions.
    </li>    
    <li>
        <strong>Data Aggregation:</strong> Functions like <code>mean</code>, <code>sum</code>, <code>max</code>, and <code>min</code> allow you to aggregate data in arrays and matrices.
    </li>    
    <li>
        <strong>Reshaping Data:</strong> You can reshape arrays and matrices using functions like <code>reshape</code> and <code>permute</code>.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Matrix Operations and Element-Wise Calculations:</h2>
<p>MATLAB is well-known for its powerful matrix capabilities. You can perform matrix operations, such as matrix multiplication (<code>*</code>), element-wise multiplication (<code>.*</code>), and more. For example:</p>
<pre><code>
A = [1, 2; 3, 4];
B = [5, 6; 7, 8];
C = A * B; % Matrix multiplication
D = A .* B; % Element-wise multiplication
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use functions like <code>transpose</code> and <code>inv</code> for matrix transposition and inversion.</p>
<h2>Handling Missing Data:</h2>
<p>Handling missing data is crucial in data analysis. In MATLAB, missing data is typically represented using the <code>NaN</code> (Not-a-Number) value. You can use various functions and techniques to handle missing data, including:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong><code>isnan</code>:</strong> This function checks for NaN values in arrays and matrices.
    </li>    
    <li>
        <strong><code>fillmissing</code>:</strong> The <code>fillmissing</code> function allows you to fill missing data using various methods, such as filling with a constant, linear interpolation, or mean/mode values.
    </li>   
    <li>
        <strong>Data Interpolation:</strong> MATLAB provides interpolation functions like <code>interp1</code> for 1-D data and <code>interp2</code> for 2-D data to estimate missing values based on surrounding data points.
    </li>   
    <li>
        <strong>Data Removal:</strong> You can remove rows or columns containing missing data using logical indexing and the <code>isnan</code> function.
    </li>    
    <li>
        <strong>Statistical Imputation:</strong> You can impute missing values using statistical techniques like mean imputation, median imputation, or regression imputation.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, MATLAB's data manipulation and preprocessing capabilities, combined with its matrix operations, make it a powerful tool for handling and preparing data for analysis, modeling, and visualization.</p>
