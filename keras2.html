</head>
<body>
    <h1>Lesson 1: Overview of neural networks.</h1>
    <p>In Lesson 1, we'll provide an in-depth understanding of neural networks. Topics covered include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are neural networks and their biological inspiration.</li>
        <li>Basic components of neural networks, such as neurons, layers, and weights.</li>
        <li>The role of activation functions and loss functions in neural networks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Code Example:</h2>
    <pre><code># No specific code example for this lesson, as it's primarily theoretical.</code></pre>
    <h1>Lesson 2: Building a simple feedforward neural network.</h1>
    <p>In Lesson 2, we'll guide you through building your first neural network using Keras. Topics covered include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Defining the architecture of a feedforward neural network.</li>
        <li>Adding layers and specifying activation functions.</li>
        <li>Configuring the input and output layers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Code Example:</h2>
    <pre><code>import tensorflow as tf
# Define a simple feedforward neural network
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])</code></pre>
    <h1>Lesson 3: Data preprocessing and model compilation.</h1>
    <p>In Lesson 3, we'll focus on preparing your data for training and configuring your model for optimization. Topics covered include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data preprocessing techniques, such as normalization and one-hot encoding.</li>
        <li>Compiling the model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Code Example:</h2>
    <pre><code># Data preprocessing example (assuming you have a dataset 'X_train' and 'y_train')
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
y_train_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(y_train)
# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])</code></pre>
    <h1>Lesson 4: Training and evaluating your model.</h1>
    <p>In Lesson 4, we'll cover the training process and evaluating the performance of your neural network. Topics covered include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Splitting data into training and validation sets.</li>
        <li>Training the model using the `fit` method and specifying batch size and number of epochs.</li>
        <li>Evaluating the model on a separate test set.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Code Example:</h2>
    <pre><code># Split data into training and validation sets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_train_scaled, y_train_encoded, test_size=0.2)
# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=64, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
# Evaluate the model on a test set
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
y_test_encoded = encoder.transform(y_test)
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test_scaled, y_test_encoded)</code></pre>
    <p>By the end of Module 2, you'll have hands-on experience in building, training, and evaluating your first neural network using Keras, along with an understanding of data preprocessing and model compilation techniques.</p>
