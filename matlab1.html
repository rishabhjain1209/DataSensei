<h1>Module 1: Introduction to MATLAB</h1>
<h2>What is MATLAB?</h2>
<p>MATLAB, short for "Matrix Laboratory," is a high-level programming language and interactive environment primarily used for numerical and scientific computing. It is developed and maintained by MathWorks. MATLAB is widely used in various fields, including engineering, physics, mathematics, finance, and more, for tasks such as data analysis, simulation, modeling, and algorithm development.</p>
<p>Key features of MATLAB include its extensive built-in libraries, powerful matrix operations, plotting and visualization tools, and a user-friendly interactive environment. MATLAB is known for its simplicity and productivity in solving complex mathematical and computational problems.</p>
<h2>MATLAB Environment and User Interface:</h2>
<p>MATLAB provides an integrated environment for both programming and interactive exploration of data and algorithms. Its user interface typically consists of the following components:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Command Window:</h3>
        <p>The Command Window is where you can enter MATLAB commands and receive immediate feedback. It's the primary interface for interactive work.</p>
    </li>   
    <li>
        <h3>Editor/Script Window:</h3>
        <p>The Editor or Script Window is used for creating, editing, and running MATLAB scripts or functions. It's especially useful for writing and managing larger pieces of code.</p>
    </li>    
    <li>
        <h3>Workspace:</h3>
        <p>The Workspace displays the current variables, their values, and data types. It allows you to inspect and manipulate data easily.</p>
    </li>    
    <li>
        <h3>Current Folder:</h3>
        <p>This panel shows the files and directories in the current working directory. You can use it to navigate and manage your MATLAB files.</p>
    </li>    
    <li>
        <h3>Command History:</h3>
        <p>The Command History keeps a record of previously executed commands, making it convenient to reuse or modify them.</p>
    </li>    
    <li>
        <h3>Plots:</h3>
        <p>MATLAB offers a wide range of tools for creating plots and visualizations. You can generate 2D and 3D plots, charts, graphs, and more.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Basic MATLAB Commands and Syntax:</h2>
<p>MATLAB commands are written using a straightforward syntax. Here are some basic examples of MATLAB commands:</p>
<pre>
<code>
% To assign a value to a variable:
x = 5; % Assigns the value 5 to the variable x
% To perform arithmetic operations:
a = 10;
b = 20;
c = a + b; % Adds a and b and assigns the result to c
% To display text or results:
disp('Hello, MATLAB!'); % Displays the text 'Hello, MATLAB!'
% To create a vector:
vector = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; % Creates a vector with elements 1 to 5
% To create a matrix:
matrix = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9]; % Creates a 3x3 matrix
% To perform element-wise operations:
A = [1, 2, 3];
B = [4, 5, 6];
C = A .* B; % Element-wise multiplication
</code>
</pre>
<h2>Variables, Data Types, and Operators:</h2>
<p>In MATLAB, variables can store various data types, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Numeric Types:</h3>
        <p>MATLAB supports various numeric types, such as double (default), single, int8, int16, int32, int64, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64. For example:</p>
        <pre>
        <code>
        x = 5; % double
        y = int16(10); % int16
        </code>
        </pre>
    </li>    
    <li>
        <h3>Strings:</h3>
        <p>MATLAB supports character arrays and string arrays for representing text:</p>
        <pre>
        <code>
        name = 'John'; % Character array
        sentence = "Hello, MATLAB!"; % String array (introduced in newer MATLAB versions)
        </code>
        </pre>
    </li>    
    <li>
        <h3>Logical:</h3>
        <p>MATLAB supports logical values (true or false) and logical arrays:</p>
        <pre>
        <code>
        flag = true;
        logicArray = [true, false, true];
        </code>
        </pre>
    </li>    
    <li>
        <h3>Complex Numbers:</h3>
        <p>MATLAB can handle complex numbers with real and imaginary parts:</p>
        <pre>
        <code>
        z = 3 + 4i; % Complex number
        </code>
        </pre>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>MATLAB provides a wide range of operators for performing operations on variables, including arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), relational operators (==, <, >, etc.), logical operators (&&, ||, ~), and more.</p>
<p>This introduction to MATLAB covers the basics of what MATLAB is, its user interface, essential commands, and the concept of variables, data types, and operators. MATLAB's versatility makes it a powerful tool for a variety of numerical and scientific computing tasks.</p>
